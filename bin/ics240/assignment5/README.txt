ExpressionSolverTester.java is posted to Assignments folder in D2L.

You will implement ExpressionSolver.java class to satisfy these test cases.

Your implementation should use Stacks and the algorithms you use should be limited to 1 or more of these algorithms listed


* 2-stack algorithm to solve fully qualified infix expressions

* 1 stack algorithm to solve post-fix

* 1 stack algorithm to convert infix to post-fix

You should submit only "ExpressionSolver.java"  (and any other supporting *.java files you used)

I will use "ExpressionSolverTester.java" to evaluate your assignment. No need to submit this tester.
