An "Assignment6.zip" file is given that contains several java classes to explore WORDS based on Themes. 
This initial list is given in a file called "new.txt" which is kept in C:\ics20 directory.

This assignment 6 is going to provide one enhancement to this program.

It is required to provide a "SEARCH" textbox next to Select a Theme.

When the user enters some text (assume that it is in ENGLISH), the GUI application detects that the user 
is trying to explore words based on some matches.

So, when the user presses NEXT button, the system needs to function as follows

(1) If the SEARCH text box is EMPTY, then the THEME takes the precedence and the system behaves as it is 
working now based on Static "Theme-Based" Collections

(2) If the SEARCH button has some text, then the system needs to build a dynamic collection of words based 
on the string match. The string match can happen anywhere in the word. 

The user can switch to "Theme" based static collection when the user clears out the search field, selects a 
theme and hits Next.

So, the system shall recognize when such mode switch is happening (from Static to Dynamic; or from Dynamic to Static)

You can add additional themes for testing purpose.
