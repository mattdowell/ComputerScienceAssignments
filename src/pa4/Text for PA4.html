<p>So shaken as we are, so wan with care,</p>
<p>Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,</p>
<p>And breathe short-winded accents of new broils</p>
<p>To be commenced in strands afar remote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No more the thirsty entrance of this soil</p>
<p>Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;</p>
<p>Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,</p>
<p>Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs</p>
<p>Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes, 10</p>
<p>Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,</p>
<p>All of one nature, of one substance bred,</p>
<p>Did lately meet in the intestine shock</p>
<p>And furious close of civil butchery</p>
<p>Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>March all one way and be no more opposed</p>
<p>Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:</p>
<p>The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,</p>
<p>No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,</p>
<p>As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross</p>
<p>We are impressed and engaged to fight,</p>
<p>Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;</p>
<p>Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb</p>
<p>To chase these pagans in those holy fields&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet</p>
<p>Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd</p>
<p>For our advantage on the bitter cross.</p>
<p>But this our purpose now is twelve month old,</p>
<p>And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear</p>
<p>Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,</p>
<p>What yesternight our council did decree</p>
<p>In forwarding this dear expedience.</p>
<p>FROM fairest creatures we desire increase,</p>
<p>That thereby beauty's rose might never die,</p>
<p>But as the riper should by time decease,</p>
<p>His tender heir might bear his memory:</p>
<p>But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,</p>
<p>Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,</p>
<p>Making a famine where abundance lies,</p>
<p>Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.</p>
<p>Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament</p>
<p>And only herald to the gaudy spring,</p>
<p>Within thine own bud buriest thy content</p>
<p>And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.</p>
<p>Pity the world, or else this glutton be,</p>
<p>To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.</p>
<p>Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest</p>
<p>Now is the time that face should form another;</p>
<p>Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,</p>
<p>Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.</p>
<p>For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb</p>
<p>Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?</p>
<p>Or who is he so fond will be the tomb</p>
<p>Of his self-love, to stop posterity?</p>
<p>Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee</p>
<p>Calls back the lovely April of her prime:</p>
<p>So thou through windows of thine age shall see</p>
<p>Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.</p>
<p>But if thou live, remember'd not to be,</p>
<p>Die single, and thine image dies with thee.</p>
<p>Those hours, that with gentle work did frame</p>
<p>The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,</p>
<p>Will play the tyrants to the very same</p>
<p>And that unfair which fairly doth excel:</p>
<p>For never-resting time leads summer on</p>
<p>To hideous winter and confounds him there;</p>
<p>Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,</p>
<p>Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:</p>
<p>Then, were not summer's distillation left,</p>
<p>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,</p>
<p>Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,</p>
<p>Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:</p>
<p>But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,</p>
<p>Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.</p>
